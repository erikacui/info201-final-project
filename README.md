Interest rates have experienced a significant rise in recent years, leading to an unprecedented downturn in the housing market. Despite house prices being notably lower than during the COVID-19 years, the overall cost has risen substantially due to the elevated interest rates imposed on buyers. Typically, it takes a minimum of 10 years for a new buyer to fully pay off their mortgage. Our project aims to delve into the impact of these dynamics on individuals with varying incomes. We find it intriguing to explore how the process of purchasing a home in today's market can be challenging, primarily due to affordability issues. The income of each individual plays a pivotal role in shaping the significance of embarking on the journey to buy a house. Achieving the ability to purchase a home and live comfortably is a formidable task. An essential question we seek to address is: What is the minimum income required for someone to afford a house? Another aspect we wish to investigate is identifying the top 10 places in the USA where buying a house is the most expensive. Additionally, we aim to compare the incomes of residents in the top 5 most expensive places with those in the top 5 least expensive places based on states. Upon completion of our data analysis, we plan to present the information in a user-friendly format, featuring a drop-down menu that allows users to select any state in the USA. On this page, users will find a graph displaying the average interest rates for housing on the right side. To enhance clarity, we will create a separate column dedicated solely to the state, especially considering that one database includes both addresses and states.

The take-away we got from the final data is that for the target audience (people with minimal knowledge of the housing market which can vary from young adults to new house buyers), people with lower income that are looking to buy a house should buy their first house in the Midwest coast, because while the Midwest has a lower average per capita income, their average house prices are the lowest compared to Hawaii, West Coast, East Coast, and the Mountains.
